DESIGN 

COMPLETENESS
The solution is completely functional 


blah blah blah 
invalid plot directives in plot input file, such as wrong number of arguments to a directive, or invalid arguments to a directive, for example
invalid plot bound (e.g., xmin is not less than xmax)
invalid image dimensions (e.g., width is not positive)
the wrong number of arguments are passed to a function (e.g., sin with more than 1 argument)
error parsing prefix expression

unknown function name in expression
error writing PNG file (image.cpp already has code to detect these errors and throw an exception)
more than one Color directive for a function
fill directive referring to a nonexistent function name
